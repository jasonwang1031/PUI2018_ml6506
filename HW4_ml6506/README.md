## Assignment 2

## Assignment 3
My idea is that the average travel time of alternative bus route is not significant different from origin X8 bus route.
My Null Hypothesis is that the average travek time of alternative bus route is equal to the X8 bus.
The Alternative Hypothesis the The average travel time of alternative bus route is not equal to the X8 bus route.
I use the Significance Level Î± = 0.05
The result is that the Z value is -2.14905157561 which is smaller than -1.96. In this case, we need to reject the Null Hypothesis.
