<div><b>Abstract&nbsp;</b></div><div>In this article, I tried to figure out if&nbsp; people born after 1980 are more likely to use CITIbike on weekend than people born before 1980.&nbsp; I applied Z- test to test my hypothesis.

They provide a low-cost,  environmentally-friendly transportation alternative for  cities. New York City launched the
largest bike-sharing system in North America, Citibike. The system
has been a success with ridership approaching 62,000 trips per day (October 2017). Exploring the characteristics of users , especially the travel behavior characteristics based on their ages, is not only very helpful to optimize the management of citi bike system but also make the customize services possible. In this case, analyzing&nbsp; the different willingness to ride of&nbsp; different age gourps users on weekend is a good begining.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>Data</b></div><div>The data comes from citibike system data website, I chose two months data: June 2015 and January 2016. The data includes: Trip Duration(    seconds) , Start Time and Date, Stop Time and Date, Start Station Name, End Station Name, Station ID, Station Lat/Long, Bike ID, User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member), Gender (Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female), Year of Birth. To complete our analysis, I only need the information of&nbsp;    Start Time and Date and Year of&nbsp; Birth.&nbsp; I divided the data into two age groups, which are people born before 1980 and people born after 1980.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
